# Challenge 06 - Weather Dashboard

## Project Description

The scheduler web app will help the end user keep track of their work schedule. It will visually inform them which events have ended, which event is currently taking place, and what their schedule looks like for the rest of the day. It also allows them to update their schedule on the fly and to come back to it throughout the day.

I used the following third party APIs/libraries to create this web app:
- Bootstrap
- Font Awesome
- Google Fonts
- jQuery
- Day.js

The library I used the most while building this app was jQuery. I am starting to feel more comfortable traversing and dynamically updating the DOM using the objects and methods available in this library as well as navigating its documentation. All in all it was a very fulfilling experience that kept me engaged as I noticed the progress I was making.
